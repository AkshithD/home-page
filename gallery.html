			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>The gallery page on my JWST website is a visual treat for anyone interested in space exploration and astronomy. This page is dedicated to showcasing the life providing substances here on earth which is something we can hope to find on other planets. The first batch consists of images of plants. These pictures show how plants look, and if we find them on other planets, it could be very important for finding life. These images capture the intricate details of plants that are invisible to the naked eye, providing a feast for the eyes.</p>
			<p>The second batch features water pictures that also play a significant role in finding life. If water is present on a planet, it increases the chances of life being there. These images offer an insight of what we can try to find on other planets using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) mission. They showcase the groundbreaking discoveries that the JWST mission will make possible and highlight the cutting-edge technology that will be used to capture data from space.</p>
			<p>I carefully selected these two groups of images to cater to a broad range of site users. The plant images and water pictures offer a chance to appreciate the beauty of space and astronomy while highlighting the importance of finding life beyond Earth. They offer something for everyone interested in space exploration and astronomy.</p>
			<p>In summary, the gallery page on my JWST website is a visual treat that appeals to anyone interested in space exploration and astronomy. The images are visually captivating and offer opportunities for learning and discovery. The plant images and water pictures allow site users to appreciate the beauty of space while highlighting the importance of finding life beyond Earth. I hope you enjoy exploring the gallery and feel inspired and awed by the majesty and wonder of the cosmos!</p>
